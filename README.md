## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a high-velocity transactional dataset of **$105.4 Million** in annual revenue and **6.0 Million units sold**. The objective was to identify "value leakage" and optimize operational efficiency across a regional network.

The core discovery of this analysis is the **"Wholesale Anomaly"**. While operating under a retail banner, the data reveals an Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) of **~$11,468**. This confirms the network effectively functions as a **B2B Wholesale Supply Hub** for local businesses rather than a standard B2C convenience chain.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
* **Data Engineering:** Used **Power Query** for ETL and the **VertiPaq compression engine** to reduce the memory footprint by ~95%, enabling complex aggregation of millions of rows.
* **Analytics Framework:** Structured via a **Metric Tree** focusing on Sales Efficiency (North Star), Customer Repeat Rate, and Inventory Velocity.
* **Visualization:** Developed a **Retail Strategic Console** and **Technical Operations Center** to track KPIs, seasonality, and regional performance.

## 📈 Key Insights & Hypothesis Testing
* **The Caffeine Economy:** Profitability is driven by habit-forming consumables. The top 10 products are dominated by **Red Bull ($1.3M revenue)** and K-Cup coffee brands, serving as a restocking hub for offices.
* **Regional Efficiency:** Rejected the claim that high-volume regions are inefficient. Data shows a near-perfect linear correlation where every region captures value at approximately **$105 per transaction**.
* **Payment Friction:** Validated that high-value shoppers prefer digital payments. **Card transactions drive $94.5M** of revenue compared to just $2.7M from cash.
* **Inventory Capacity:** Rejected the "Dead Stock" hypothesis. Even the lowest-selling items move over **21,000 units annually**, indicating a capacity and fulfillment challenge rather than a demand issue.

## 👤 Target Personas
To operationalize these insights, two primary personas were developed:
1.  **"Office Manager Karen" (The Whale):** Controls large budgets, buys bulk breakroom supplies (50+ cases of coffee), and requires high-speed checkout for large baskets.
2.  **"Small Biz Owner Raj" (The Reseller):** Operates local kiosks, buys high-velocity soda/water (46k unit volume), and is highly sensitive to stockouts.

## 🚀 Strategic Roadmap
1.  **Operational Efficiency:** Implement **"Pro-Lane" Card-Only Bulk Express Lanes** to reduce checkout time for "Whales" by ~40%.
2.  **Growth Strategy:** Launch a **B2B Referral Program** to break the current 9,191 unique customer ceiling by targeting corporate accounts.
3.  **Inventory Expansion:** Capture additional "Share of Wallet" by expanding into **Adjunct Categories** like bulk cleaning supplies and paper products.
